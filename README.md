# PROJECTS INDEX

## Diabetes Prediction - KNIME Challenge
The project, which was submitted as an entry for the KNIME Challenge, consists in building a model to predict the probability of having diabetes based on sex, BMI, medical information, daily habits and personal health rating. Patients that are more likely to have diabetes should undergo further medical tests. The most fitting model resulted to be a logistic regression, that showed an accuracy of ∼75% and a LogLoss of ∼0.5 while maintaining low computation times. This project was done in collaboration with William Joseph Borruso and Davide Ronchi.

## Global Energy Outlook
The project focuses on producing visualizations on data we collected about global energy consumption, electricity generation and greenhouse gas emissions. This paper refers to the dashboards contained in a Tableau presentation accessible from [this link](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/davide.ronchi/viz/GlobalEnergyOutlook-Presentazione/Presentazione?publish=yes). User tests were also performed and are accessible from [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/davide.ronchi/viz/GlobalEnergyOutlook-Presentazione/Presentazione?publish=yes). This project was done in collaboration with William Joseph Borruso and Davide Ronchi.

## Comparative Weather Analysis
In this project we perform a whole data management process, from the collection of weather forecasts and measurements from three of the most popular weather websites in Italy, to their preparation, enrichment and aggregation, aimed at producing a final database that makes it possible to assess which website had the most accurate predictions. This project was done in collaboration with William Joseph Borruso and Davide Ronchi.

## ECG Neural Network - Presentation
With this presentation we showcased project in which we built a Convolutional Neural Network (+LSTM Network) over Electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings (which we augmented), in order to classify the signals and identify which ones presented Atrial Fibrillation or other anomalies. We obtained an 85% accuracy on test set. This project was done in collaboration with Christian Persico and Enrico Mannarino.

## Marketing Analytics Presentation
This presentation shows the results of my customer-focused marketing analysis on e-commerce data. I manipulated data and used ML models and eXplainable AI methods to identify high value customers and churners based on their personal information, behaviors and reviews, and suggested a simple marketing campaign to increase revenue.

## Text Mining on IMDB Movie Reviews
In this project we are given a large dataset of movie reviews from IMDB. We perform text preprocessing, sentiment classification, unsupervised text clustering and topic modeling. This project was done in collaboration with William Joseph Borruso and Eugenia Suriani.

## Life Expectancy Prediction
The project consists in predicting life expectancy of a country in a specific year starting from information from different countries from 2000 to 2015. This project was done in collaboration with William Joseph Borruso and Davide Ronchi.

## Ecography Annotation Thesis (:it:)
This document contains a summary of my graduation thesis in Computer Science for Digital Communication (2019-2022), about a system for ecographies annotation I realized during my internship with the EveryWare Lab (University of Milan) in collaboration with Policlinico of Milan. The purpose is to realize a reliable annotated dataset to support medical decisions, which can be also used to train an algorithm which can detect hemarthroses and therefore allow patients to use portable ecographs to scan their joints in complete autonomy. I took part in the decisional process and realized both the web app and the database. I didn't publish the full thesis on this GitHub.
