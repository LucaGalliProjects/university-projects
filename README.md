# PROJECTS INDEX

## Diabetes Prediction - KNIME Challenge
The project, which was submitted as an entry for the KNIME Challenge, consists in building a model to predict the probability of having diabetes based on sex, BMI, medical information, daily habits and personal health rating. Patients that are more likely to have diabetes should undergo further medical tests. The most fitting model resulted to be a logistic regression, that showed an accuracy of ∼75% and a LogLoss of ∼0.5 while maintaining low computation times. This project was done in collaboration with William Joseph Borruso and Davide Ronchi.

## Life Expectancy prediction
The project consists in predicting life expectancy of a country in a specific year starting from information from different countries from 2000 to 2015. This project was done in collaboration with William Joseph Borruso and Davide Ronchi.
